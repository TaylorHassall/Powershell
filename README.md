# Powershell
Repo for all the powershells scripts I have developed for use in automating tasks that will be too long to do manually. Most ofte relating to Active Directory or file finding.

I am no expert in Powershell.

There are almost certainly better ways to complete everything I have done in this repo. Please do not hesitate to correct or provide better solutions as you see fit.
